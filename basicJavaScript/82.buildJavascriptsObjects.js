/* Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes 
   to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects 
   through what are called properties.
   Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, 
   and can represent real world objects. */

// They are structured in a key[or else property]: value format, seperated by commas.  
// If a value has multiple entries, use an array ["" , ""], seperated inside by commas. 

// Sample
const cat = {
    "name": "Whiskers",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
  };
  
// Exercise

const myDog = {
    // Only change code below this line
    name: "rufus",
    legs: 4,
    tails: 1,
    friends: ["animals", "Humans"]
  
    // Only change code above this line
  };
